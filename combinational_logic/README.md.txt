# Verilog Projects â€“ Combinational Logic

This repository contains multiple Verilog-based combinational logic designs. Each folder represents a separate project with its own Verilog source code, testbench, and simulation result images.

## Tools Used

- Xilinx Vivado for design and simulation
- GitHub Desktop for version control

## How to Run

1. Open the `.v` files in Vivado or any Verilog simulator.
2. Simulate using the testbench.
3. View waveform outputs to verify functionality.
