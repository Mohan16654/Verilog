# Sequential Logic Designs

This folder contains various **sequential logic circuits** implemented in **Verilog HDL** and simulated using **Vivado**. Each project includes its Verilog source code, testbench, and simulation results.

## Topics Covered

The following sequential circuits are designed and verified:

- **Shift Registers**
- **Counters**
- **Flip-Flops**

## Structure

Each subfolder contains:
- `*.v` — Verilog source files
- `*_tb.v` — Testbenches
- Simulation waveforms (as `.png`)

## Tools Used

- **Vivado** for simulation and design

## Author
