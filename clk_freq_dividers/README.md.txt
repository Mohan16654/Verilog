Clock Frequency Divider Designs

Hey! This folder contains my Verilog designs for clock frequency dividers.

Iâ€™ve implemented basic dividers like divide-by-2, divide-by-4, etc. These are really useful when you want to slow down the clock for other parts of a circuit.

I'm learning sequential logic and designing these felt great. Seeing them work correctly in simulation made me happy!

That's it. Feel free to explore!
