Dual Port RAM 

Hey there!
This repo contains my Verilog implementation of a **Dual Port RAM** â€” a powerful memory design that allows simultaneous **read** and **write** operations using two independent ports. I had a great time building and simulating this!

What is Dual Port RAM?

Unlike Single Port RAM, where read and write can't happen truly at the same time, **Dual Port RAM** supports:
-Writing data through **Port A**
-Reading data from **Port B**
-All in the **same clock cycle**! 

Features

- **Separate read and write addresses**
- **Independent data lines for input and output**
- **Synchronous operations**
- Tested on **Vivado** with clear simulation results

Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Vivado Simulator
